# draft-js-editor

A rich text editor built using facebook's [draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/). 

Takes inspiration from the text editors on [medium](http://medium.com) and 
[facebook notes](https://www.facebook.com/notes/).

# Get started

Run `npm install` then `npm start`

# Here from npm?

If you're seeing this on npm, this is currently just an example repo on Github 
that demos a rich text editor. Will be packaged more nicely soon.
